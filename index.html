      <h4>Career Objective</h4>
      <p>I want to be a good human being as well as good researcher.</p>

      <h4>Research Interest</h4>
      <p>Nowadays consumption of fruits and vegetables has been increased due to ample of valuable compounds. Plants and animal by-products are obtained during processing which can be used not only functional ingredients but also a good source of bioactive compounds. So that, I am very much interested to extract and purification of bioactive compounds from plants and animal sources. I also want to use bioactive compounds as value added products. In addition, I am keenly interested to use modern food processing technology such as high hydrostatic pressure, pulse electric field and so on.</p>
